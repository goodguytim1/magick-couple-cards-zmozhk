Create the Main Magick screen and Settings screen within the `app/(tabs)` directory.\n3.  **UI Components:** Develop reusable UI components for cards, buttons, toggles, and location display.\n4.  **Main Magick Screen:** Implement the deck selection, card drawing, shuffling, favoriting, and daily card features. Integrate the location API to display nearby venues.\n5.  **Settings Screen:** Implement the account settings, consent toggles, and theme/monetization preferences.\n6.  **Data Storage:** Utilize AsyncStorage for storing favorites, theme, and monetization mode.\n7.  **Styling:** Apply the specified color palette and typography to the UI components.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the `app/(tabs)` folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n\nFinally, the coding agent should remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-16T22:13:58.183647"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the Magick mobile app!
